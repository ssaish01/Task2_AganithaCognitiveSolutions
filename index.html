            FACT SHEET: How the Inflation Reduction Act Helps Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander
            Communities

            By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on his promise to build an economy
            that works for working families, including Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and
            NHPI) families. The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug costs, health care costs, and energy
            costs. It’s the most aggressive action we have taken to confront the climate crisis. It’ll lower the deficit
            and ask the super wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. And no one making under $400,000 per
            year will pay a penny more in taxes.

            President Biden and Congressional Democrats beat back the special interests to pass this historic
            legislation that lowers costs for Americans and their families, advances environmental justice while
            building a cleaner future, and grows the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.

            LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS
            The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will lower health care costs, including prescription drug costs, and
            expand health insurance coverage for AA and NHPI families.

            Lower Prescription Drug Costs for Seniors: Americans pay 2-3 times more for their prescription drugs than
            people in other wealthy countries. Nearly 1 in 4 Americans struggle to afford prescription drugs, and high
            prices contribute to racial and ethnic health inequities. The Inflation Reduction Act will help close the
            gap in access to medication by improving prescription drug coverage and lowering drug prices in Medicare.
            The law:
        <ul>
            <li> Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for prescription drugs they buy at the pharmacy at $2,000
                a year, giving peace of mind to seniors who no longer have to worry about spending thousands and
                thousands more on prescription drugs.
            </li>
            <li>Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for insulin at $35 for a month’s supply.
            </li>
            <li>Provides access to a number of additional free vaccines, including the shingles vaccine, for Medicare
                beneficiaries.
            </li>
            <li>Will further lower prescription drug costs for seniors by allowing Medicare to negotiate the price of
                high-cost drugs and requiring drug manufacturers to pay Medicare a rebate when they raise prices faster
                than inflation.
            </li>
        </ul>
